# Jailbreak Kit

Instructions and resources necessary to jailbreak a Kindle PW3.
This was made, so i had what i needed in one place.

Feel free to fork the repo, and add whatever you need.

## BEFORE YOU START

Make sure the Kindle is on firmware 5.9.6.1 or LESS. Otherwise you done goofed.

I recommend backing up your kindle, removing network credentials and wiping it before you start. When you're done, it's safe to connect to wifi again.

You shouldn't worry about getting device banned from the Amazon Store. Why would they ban you from spending money?
