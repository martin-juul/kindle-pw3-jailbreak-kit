Part 1 - Install MRPI (MobileRead Package Installer)

MRPI requires KUAL, as it's a KUAL extension, but it has to be installed first.

1. Connect kindle to computer
2. Extract kual-mrinstaller-1.7.N-r16737.tar.xz
3. Copy the folders [extensions,mrpackages] of kual-mrinstaller-1.7.N-r16737 to root of your Kindle
4. Go to part 2

Part 2 - Install KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher)

Here we'll install the coplate (booklet) version, as that's required for fw 5.9+ - which we installed in section 1.

1. Extract KUAL-f54e864-20191030.tar.xz
2. Copy Update_KUALBooklet_f54e864_install.bin to Kindle -> mrpackages
3. Eject Kindle
4. Unplug USB
5. Engage search bar
6. Type ;log mrpi
7. Press enter

You should now see "hush baby" over the spacebar. Then the startup logo for kual (box).
After that the install log will be displayed.

Your kindle then reboots, finishing the process.
